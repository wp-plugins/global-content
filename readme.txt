Define only once some global content and reuse easily in templates and posts/pages as many times as required

== Description ==

Global Content by BusinessBox allows you to define at only one place some content globally used all over your website.

Hence it prevents from writing mutlitple times some hardly-maintenable text. 

Plain text as well as more complex HTML/CSS code can be put in each of those global variables.

Simply use this content in either your templates by using our PHP function `gcbb_get` or directly in the content of posts or pages using a modifiable tag such as `[GCBB#variable]`.
